## Reply to the weakness of the paper
We will respond to the [weaknesses of the paper](https://github.com/Changboyang/STR/blob/main/Weakness%20respond.pdf) one by one. Note that this content is not the same as a rebuttal.

## Code
Coming soon...

## Qualitative Videos
We present qualitative videos (video1, video2).
